# Building A Scatterplot Using D3

This is a full day tutorial on building a scatterplot using D3. It explores key concepts in D3.js by building up an example, step by step, from a bare-bones scatterplot that loads external data to an interactive, animated scatterplot that allows the user to filter data based on legend choice.  

Here's a breakdown of the steps we'll be covering: 

#### Module 1: [Importing Data](module-1-importing-data.md) - 30min 

In this module we will cover the basics of using several D3 convenience methods to import data.  The native d3.csv method will be reviewed as well as additional modules such as 

#### Module 2: [Rendering Data](module-2-rendering-data.md) - 60min

In this module we will use D3 to create basic shapes manually and then work with the d3-shape module to implement additional shapes as well.  

#### Module 3: [Adding Axes](module-3-adding-axes.md)
#### Module 4: [Adding Circle & Line Transitions](module-4-adding-circle-line-transitions.md)
#### Module 5: [Adding A Tooltip](module-5-adding-a-tooltip.md) 
#### Module 6: [Adding A Legend](module-6-adding-a-legend.md)
#### Module 7: [Using Leged To Filter Dataset](module-7-using-legend-to-filter-dataset.md)
#### Module 8: [Reusable Components](module-8-reuseable-components.md)
