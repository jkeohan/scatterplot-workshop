# Building A Scatterplot Using D3

This is a full day tutorial on building a scatterplot using D3. It explores key concepts in D3.js by building up an example, step by step, from a bare-bones scatterplot that loads external data to an interactive, animated scatterplot that allows the user to filter data based on legend choice.  

Here's a breakdown of the steps we'll be covering: 

- Importing Data & Rendering Circles
- Adding X & Y Scales
- Adding X & Y Axes
