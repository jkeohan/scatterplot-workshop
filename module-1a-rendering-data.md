## Rendering Data 

#### Starter Code

The starter code for this section has been provided so please fork the following codepen: 

[D3 - Scatterplot - Rendering Data - Starter](https://codepen.io/jkeohan/pen/wyOzxM?editors=0010)

#### Intro

The most important feature of D3 is most notably it's ability to represent the data in many different ways such as circles, rectangles, lines, ect.  Although these basic shapes are almost always enough to build out the most common charts and graphs they can be used in innovative ways that allow one to add flare to their visualization. 

#### Getting Started

Although building out a basic scatterplot is pretty straighforward using D3 there are things that we should consider that will affect how we structure the code for both this design and for future resuability. Let's make sure we first understand the full functionality of our visualization before we start adding additional lines of code. Here is the [final version](https://codepen.io/jkeohan/pen/OQwwKO?editors=0010) of the scatterplot so let's examine it first and then come up with a list of functionality that we will need to build out. 

#### Functionality Defined

Here is a list of the functionality that has been implemented:


- Renders basic circles color coded by region
- Legend with regional names and defined colors
- X\Y Axes and axis titles
- Filtering and rerendering data
- Animations for circles, lines, opacities, axes
- Responsive design


#### Solution Code
